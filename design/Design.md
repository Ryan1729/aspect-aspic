* Created Orb: ![concentric-orb.png](https://github.com/Ryan1729/aspect-aspic/raw/master/design/concentric-orb.png) Created when the player throws a Charged Orb at a Dead Orb.  When the player bumps into it it is activated, and it's aspects are thrown outwards in the process


Taking inspiration from the Magic the Gathering colour pie, Let's try the following aspects:

  --- | --- | --- | --- | --- 
Red  | Moves towards nearest other thing | Shoots healing ray towards most injured other | Moves towards most injured other and then heals it | Heals everyone
White | Stays in the center of it's cell | Moves in coordination with other white creatures to make a symmetrical pattern | pushes / attacks other creatures/orbs to make ***the*** pattern | rearranges everyone into ***the*** pattern
Black | Moves to the safest place it can | Moves towards where it can be healed | Evaluates White creature situation and moves in accordance with their pattern if White is "in power" | Creates more black orbs/creatures
